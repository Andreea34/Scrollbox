# scrollbox
Scrollbox is a cross-browser plugin that keeps the full length of your webpage in view. It does this by listening for the window.resize() (JS) event, and dynamically adjusting the height of all .scrollbox (CSS) elements on the page.

## options
By default, scrollbox allows scrolling on both axes and has a {min-height} of 200px. 
Specific scroll behaviour can be set with .scroll-x and .scroll-y. 
Specific height limits can be set with {min-height} and {max-height}. 

## dependencies
Needs both scrollbox.css and scrollbox.js files to work. No styling or scripting frameworks required.
