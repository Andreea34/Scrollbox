  <h1>Scrollbox Demo</h1>
  <p>
    Scrollbox is a cross-browser plugin that keeps the full length of your webpage in view.
    It does this by listening for the <code class="javascript">window.resize()</code> event,
    and dynamically adjusting the height of all <code class="css">.scrollbox</code>
    elements on the page.
  </p>

  <p>Resize your browser window to see Scrollbox in action.</p>

  <!-- default -->
  <h2>Scrollbox Default</h2>
  <p>Scrolls on both axes and has a <code class="css">{min-height}</code> of 200px.</p>
